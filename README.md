To use the To-Do List project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine:
`git clone https://github.com/Keyurx11/to-do-s-list.git`

Navigate to the project directory:

`cd to-do-s-list`

Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to use the to-do list.

The to-do list should now be operational. You can add items to the list by typing them into the input field and clicking the "Add" button.

To mark an item as complete, click the checkbox next to the item.

To delete an item from the list, click the "Delete" button next to the item.

If you want to make changes to the to-do list or add new features, you can do so by editing the `main.js` file. Make sure to test your changes to ensure that they do not break the to-do list.
